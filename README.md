- [x] The technical write-up of the web storage selection is below.
- [x] Fill out the self-evaluation form.
- [x] Submit the repository link and list of group members, if applicable, to Canvas.

## How to test the Application:

* Where and how is web storage used?
The web storage is stored locally on the user's computer.
* What are application use cases?
The user will be able to make themselves a to-do list, inputting each thing to do individually by pressing enter or the submit button, and then to clear all of it, the clear all button.
## Technical Write-up of selection of web storage solution:
Choosing to localStorage is what seemed logical for this kinda of application. I want users to create their list but also be able to come back to them without the list disappearing if they accidentally close their browser. I wanted them to be able to access their list from a different window and to have the data stored to never expire, compared to sessionStorage where data is stored within the tab, but doesn't save the data when the tab/browser is closed.  
## Self Reflection(s):
I wanted to get fancy with this application where I could clear individual things on the list, but it was just really difficult, but the main part of coding this application wasn't bad and rather satisfying.
## How long it took me/us to finish this:
2 hours
